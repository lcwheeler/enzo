# enzo
*enzo* is a Python wrapper for Tellurium that allows evolution of metabolic models between defined phenotypic states.
Please use enzo in a Python 3.6+ environment to ensure compatibility. This package is 
a work in progress, hence the reason that the code is in flux. It is neither as fast nor as generalizable as I would 
like it to be, but I am working toward improvements to make it more flexible.
The main reason I have made *enzo* available is to ensure that the work I have used it for can be readily reproduced 
after installing the package. However, feel free to use *enzo* for other projects at your own peril! Currently there 
is no Documentation page, beyond this README and the example Jupyter notebooks, but I will work on that after my 
colleagues and I have solidified changes and redesignes to allow more flexibility in user-input fitness, mutation, 
and fixation probability functions. If there are any issues, please let me know by filing an issue report on github. 
Pull requests with improvements are welcome too! 

Example:

This example re-runs the stochastic evolutionary simulations performed in our paper [Computational modeling of anthocyanin pathway evolution: Biases, hotspots, and trade-offs](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/01/03/511089).
